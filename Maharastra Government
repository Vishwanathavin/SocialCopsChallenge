INput data details:
	Nature of the data: How many APMC, average number of COmmondities, average number of months per APMC for which data is available


Methodology:
	Compartmentalization of data based on indices

	Removing the outlier from the data set: Explain the inten behind the removal. Why it might be a costly mistake to remove the data . Explain the rationale behind the standard deviation and why it might have to be decided after carefule scrutiny

	Interpolation of data: Weekwise. Linear interpolation
		Intention: Will help us fill the missing and easier to find patterns

	Extrapolation of MSP
		Intention. Will help us find the fluctuation for years where it is not available


	Deflation: Not performed since we are interested in computing the differnce between two entities that are equally affected as a result of inflation. 

	Removing seasonality:
		Assuming a monthly seasonal cycle. Used the python package seasonal_decompose to separate the noise, trend and seasonality

	out of scope:
		Finding the ideal seasonal value by iterating on the frequency of the cycle and cheking the auto correlation factor to make sure the residual noise is entirely random. Owing to time constaint, this was not implemented.

	Calculating the fluctuation for each time index: 
		Difference between the APMC and MSP and storing against each time index

		Save this file as an output file

	Do a commodity wise, season wise scanning and flag the APMC which has a huge fluctuation

	Do a kick ass graph which explains it all
