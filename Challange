Aim: To understand trends in APMC price & quantity arrival data for different commodities in Maharashtra.

What we expect to have: Various commodities, its price, quantity of arrival, Different location

Objective:
	1. Filter outliers: 
		Reading 1:
		How: Either we can plot or think of some other technique to do the same
		What to plot and how. 
		One solution is using standard deviation techniques. Read about it: 
		This has to be applied on the monthly file



	2. Understand price fluctuations accounting seasonal effect for EACH CLUSTER and COMMODITY (is it month wise or what wise)
		How: We need to calculate the multiplicative seasonal index for each commodity and the cluster 
			 We need to think of how to cluster them . On what basis


	3. Adjust the prices after multiplying by the index
	How: read about how to adjust the prices on using mutiplicative index


	4. Compare prices with Minimum support price
	 Question: Should we deseasonalize this too? Find out how?
	 How: to compare the prices. Just a difference would suffice?

	5. Flag set of APMC/mandis and commodities with highest price fluctuation across different commodities in each relevant season, and year.
	How: Find the ones that very different than the market price. Do it for each commodity for each season for each year. 

	What are we achieving by that: 


	What data do we have
	

	Steps to do:

	Filter outliers
		Take the APMC file and for each commodity, for each APMC get the outlier across the various seasons
		Read: how to filter outliers. Use the average value they used

	Get the fluctuations
		Read: How to plot the trends, should we do a fitting of some sort

	Normalize the data:
		Use multiplicative indices to normalize the data

		Do it for MSP too

	Difference:

		Items that have a 



Productising:

A website where we can give filter to find how much fluctuation is happening
